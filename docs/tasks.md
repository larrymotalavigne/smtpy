- [x] Add user ownership relationships for domains and aliases
- [x] Implement soft delete functionality for important entities
- [x] Add string length constraints to database fields

## High Priority Issues

### Code Quality & Architecture
- [x] Fix duplicate route definition in `main_view.py` (lines 22 and 127 both define "/")
